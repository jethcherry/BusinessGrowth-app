This repository contains a Flask API implementation for serving predictions using a pickled Random Forest Classifier model. Users can make HTTP POST requests to the /predict endpoint with input data in JSON format, and the API returns predicted class labels. The model file should be placed in the models/ directory and should have a .pkl extension. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook (train_model.ipynb) is provided in the notebooks/ directory for retraining the model or training a new one. Instructions for installing dependencies, starting the Flask server, and making prediction requests are provided in the README. This project is licensed under the MIT License. To test the Flask API using Postman, start the Flask server, open Postman, create a new request with the appropriate POST method and endpoint URL (http://localhost:5000/predict), set the request body to raw JSON format, enter your input data, and send the request
